## Amazon CloudTrail

Amazon CloudTrail is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables you to monitor and log API activity and account-related events within your AWS infrastructure. It records and stores a history of actions taken by users, services, and resources, providing an audit trail for security analysis, compliance, and troubleshooting purposes.

- Event Logging: CloudTrail captures and logs events related to API calls made within your AWS account. It records details such as the identity of the caller, the timestamp of the action, the specific API invoked, and the resources involved. These logs are saved to an Amazon S3 bucket or delivered to CloudWatch Logs.

- Visibility and Governance: CloudTrail helps you gain visibility into the activity occurring across your AWS resources and accounts. It provides an audit trail that allows you to track changes, investigate security incidents, perform forensic analysis, and meet compliance requirements.
