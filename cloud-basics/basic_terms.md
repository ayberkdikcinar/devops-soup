# Cloud Computing Basics

**1. Cloud Computing:**
   - **Definition:** Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services (such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and more) over the internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

**2. Availability:**
   - **Definition:** Availability refers to the uptime and accessibility of a cloud service or resource. It measures how reliably a service can be accessed without downtime.
   - **Importance:** High availability ensures that applications and services are accessible and operational when needed, minimizing disruptions.

**3. Scalability:**
   - **Definition:** Scalability is the ability of a system or application to handle an increase in workload by adding resources, such as servers or storage, to meet growing demand.
   - **Types:** Horizontal scaling (adding more identical resources) and vertical scaling (increasing the power of existing resources).

**4. Elasticity:**
   - **Definition:** Elasticity is a subset of scalability, emphasizing the ability to automatically and dynamically allocate or release resources based on real-time demand, optimizing cost and performance.

**5. Virtualization:**
   - **Definition:** Virtualization is the process of creating virtual versions of computing resources (e.g., servers, storage, networks) to abstract physical hardware and optimize resource utilization.
   - **Types:** Server virtualization, storage virtualization, network virtualization.

**6. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**
   - **Definition:** IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including virtual machines, storage, and networking, allowing users to manage and control the underlying infrastructure.

**7. Platform as a Service (PaaS):**
   - **Definition:** PaaS offers a platform that includes both infrastructure and development tools for building, deploying, and managing applications without the complexities of managing infrastructure.

**8. Software as a Service (SaaS):**
   - **Definition:** SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis, enabling users to access and use software without the need for installation or maintenance.

**9. Function as a Service (FaaS):**
   - **Definition:** FaaS, also known as serverless computing, allows developers to run individual functions or pieces of code in response to events or triggers without managing servers or infrastructure.

**10. Public Cloud:**
   - **Definition:** Public cloud services are hosted by cloud providers and accessible to the general public over the internet. Users pay for the resources they consume.

**11. Private Cloud:**
    - **Definition:** Private cloud is a cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization, providing greater control and security. It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.

**12. Hybrid Cloud:**
    - **Definition:** Hybrid cloud combines both public and private cloud environments, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. It offers flexibility and data control.

**13. Multi-tenancy:**
    - **Definition:** Multi-tenancy is a cloud architecture where a single instance of software serves multiple customers (tenants), while keeping their data and configurations separate.

**14. Load Balancing:**
    - **Definition:** Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources to improve application availability, scalability, and performance.

**15. Disaster Recovery (DR):**
    - **Definition:** Disaster recovery involves the process of preparing for and recovering from potential data loss or system downtime, often through backup and redundancy measures.

**16. Redundancy:**
    - **Definition:** Redundancy in cloud computing involves duplicating critical components or resources to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

**17. Data Center:**
    - **Definition:** A data center is a facility housing computing, networking, and storage equipment to support cloud services, including servers, routers, and storage arrays.
    - **Types:** On-premises data centers, colocation data centers, cloud provider data centers.
